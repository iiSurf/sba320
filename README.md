# SBA 320 - Two Page React Application

> [!NOTE]
> Explanations of the technologies used.
- Axios - This handles data fetching with an API such as the news API.

- REACT - To be able to use reusable components to build a single page application. Navigates between different pages while all in a single page application.

- CSS - Makes my application pretty and easy on the eyes and fun animations.

- HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language and with the index.html file to have a div to then use react to build up the application.

- Vite - This is a fast development environment setup to quickly get started with REACT.

> [!TIP]
> Explanations of the approach taken.
- I started with the idea of either a bus route api application or a news application. Given the limited time allowed to work on either project, the news api looked to check all the boxes required from the rubric and simple-ish enough to learn with and create something. It was still very hard and ran in to a lot of bugs especially import errors that caused CSS to not work at all many times. I leanred now that you have to attach .css to the end of the import file path... But for jsx imports you do not need to add the file tag.
I started with choosing an api, got that to be connected to my react vite server on my local machine and then when I did not have anymore errors I then went on to work with css to make it functional and pretty.
